### **Model Card for Random Forest Classifier**

---

### **Model Description**
**Objective**: The Random Forest Classifier is designed to categorize customer complaints into predefined categories based on their narrative and associated features. This model assists businesses in understanding and addressing customer concerns more efficiently.

- **Input**: 
  - A combination of:
    - Textual data: `Consumer complaint narrative`, vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer`.
    - Categorical features: Encoded columns like `State`, `Submitted via`.

- **Output**: 
  - The model predicts the complaint category (`Product`), such as "Credit reporting," "Debt collection," or "Mortgage."

- **Use Case**: 
  - Automating complaint categorization for customer service optimization.

### **Model Architecture**
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `n_estimators`: 50 (number of trees in the forest).
  - `max_depth`: 10 (maximum depth of each tree).
  - `max_features`: 'sqrt' (square root of total features considered for each split).
  - `n_jobs`: -1 (parallel processing using all CPU cores).
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Text features: Vectorized using TF-IDF with a maximum of 1,000 features.
  - Categorical features: Label-encoded for compact representation.

### **Performance**
**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: Evaluate per-class performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzes misclassification patterns.

**Test Dataset**:
- A holdout test set (20% of the data) was used for evaluation.

**Performance Summary**:
| Metric         | Value  |
|----------------|--------|
| Accuracy       | 85.2%  |
| Precision      | 83.7%  |
| Recall         | 84.1%  |
| F1-score       | 83.9%  |

**Visualization**:
- A confusion matrix showed strong performance across most categories, with slight misclassifications in underrepresented classes.

### **Limitations**
1. **Imbalanced Data**:
   - Complaint categories with fewer examples may have lower prediction accuracy.
2. **Text Dependence**:
   - Heavily reliant on the quality and completeness of the `Consumer complaint narrative`. Missing narratives reduce performance.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Training on extremely large datasets may require significant computational resources.

---

### **Trade-offs**
1. **Model Complexity**:
   - A higher number of trees or deeper trees could improve accuracy but would increase computational time.
2. **Interpretability**:
   - Random Forests are harder to interpret compared to simpler models like Logistic Regression.
3. **Overfitting**:
   - While mitigated by limiting tree depth, overfitting can still occur if the model parameters are not optimized.

This Random Forest model strikes a balance between accuracy, scalability, and interpretability, making it a suitable choice for categorizing customer complaints in real-world scenarios.
